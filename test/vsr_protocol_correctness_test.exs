  Tests for VSR protocol correctness issues identified in security reviews.
  
  These tests verify that the VSR implementation correctly handles:
  - PrepareOk routing with leader_id
  - View validation in Heartbeat messages  
  - Committed operation application after view changes
  - Secure NewState handling
  - Correct quorum thresholds
  - Proper log selection during view changes
  - Timer resets on role changes
  - View-keyed prepare_ok_count
  - Client deduplication
