Here’s a protocol-level review focused only on VSR/VR\* semantics (not syntax, style, or message plumbing). I’ll go top-down and call out safety first, then liveness & spec deviations, and finish with concrete fixes you can drop in.

\* I’m referencing the “Viewstamped Replication Revisited” terminology.

---

# TL;DR (what’s correct vs. what’s risky)

**Solid / on-track**

* Primary drives the log with `Prepare`; replicas accept only at `log_length + 1` → preserves the “no holes” property.
* ACK accounting is keyed by `{view, op}` so cross-view contamination is avoided.
* Commit on the primary requires > N/2 `PrepareOk` (you pre-seed count with the leader’s own write), and you broadcast `Commit`.
* View change: you gather `DoViewChange` on the primary-of-v, pick the log with max `(last_normal_view, op_number)` and set `commit_number := max(commits)` → that’s the core VR merge rule.
* Receiving `Prepare` from a higher view causes the follower to adopt the new view immediately (good for quick convergence).

**Safety bugs / correctness gaps**

1. **Replica does not check for log conflicts when `op_number <= log_length`.**
   In `prepare_impl/2` you unconditionally send `PrepareOk` if `prepare.op_number <= log_length`. If the entry at `op_number` differs (different operation or view), you can acknowledge a conflicting history → violates VR’s log-matching invariant.

2. **Primary election must be deterministic; using arbitrary terms (especially PIDs) to order members is unsafe.**
   `primary/1` and `primary_for_view/2` compute the leader by `Enum.sort([self | replicas])`. If node IDs are PIDs or otherwise not a globally stable, comparable ordering across processes/environments, different replicas can disagree on who the primary for a view is → split brain.

3. **Quorum size inconsistency (potentially unsafe with custom `cluster_size`).**
   Commit threshold uses `connected_replicas = MapSet.size(state.replicas) + 1`, while other places reference `state.cluster_size`. If a caller sets `cluster_size` larger than `|replicas|+1`, you could commit with fewer than a strict majority of `cluster_size`.

4. **Conflict recovery only handles “gaps”, not “mismatch”.**
   You request `GetState` when `prepare.op_number > log_length + 1`. You **don’t** request recovery (or truncate) when `op_number <= log_length` but contents mismatch. That leaves the system able to drift into divergent logs that you still ACK.

**Spec / behavior deviations & liveness nits (not strictly unsafe)**
5\. **Start-View-Change handshake naming/flow.**
You use `StartViewChange` + broadcast `StartViewChangeAck`, then emit `DoViewChange` after a majority of **ACKs**. This can work (your ACK is effectively a “me too, I’m in view-change v”), but it differs from the usual “count `StartViewChange` messages”. It’s okay if (and only if) nodes broadcast an ACK *iff* they have themselves entered view-change v (your code does that), but the intent is subtle.

6. **`GetState`’s view field.**
   When a follower sees a higher-view `Prepare`, if it hits a gap you send `GetState` with `view: state.view_number` (the old view), not `prepare.view`. Minor, but it makes it easier to reject state transfer incorrectly.

7. **Commit advancement semantics are fine but implicit.**
   `maybe_commit_operation/2` advances `commit_number` straight to the op that just reached majority. That’s safe in VR since acceptance at `i+1` implies the same majority has `≤ i` due to “append only at `log_length + 1`”, but it’s worth a comment in code to avoid accidental future changes.

8. **Client deduplication semantics are incomplete.**
   If a duplicate request (same `client_id/request_id`) arrives **while the first is still processing**, you “do nothing”. Only the original `from` gets the reply; the retried caller starves. That’s not a VR safety issue, but it breaks “at-most-once with retries”.

9. **Timers after adopting a new leader via `Prepare`.**
   When a node inappropriately believes it’s primary then adopts a higher-view `Prepare`, its heartbeat timer is left to fire once (harmless) but isn’t actively canceled. Not unsafe—just noisy.

10. **`NewState` acceptance does not reset per-view counters/timers.**
    After `NewState`, you don’t clear `prepare_ok_count` or adjust timers based on role in the new view. Again not unsafe, but you’ll carry dead counters.

# Concrete fixes (minimal, surgical)

## 1) Detect and handle **conflicts** when `op_number <= log_length`

In `prepare_impl/2`, add a fetch and compare:

```elixir
# inside the clause where prepare.view == state.view_number (or after adopting view)
log_length = get_log_length(state)

cond do
  prepare.op_number == log_length + 1 ->
    # existing path (append)
    ...

  prepare.op_number <= log_length ->
    case state.module.log_fetch(state.log, prepare.op_number) do
      {:ok, %LogEntry{view: v, operation: op}} when v == prepare.view and op == prepare.operation ->
        # exact match – idempotent ACK
        send_prepare_ok(state, prepare)
        {:noreply, state}

      _ ->
        # conflict: request state transfer (or truncate then catch up)
        primary_node = prepare.leader_id || primary(state)
        send_to(state, primary_node, %GetState{
          view: prepare.view,     # use leader's view
          op_number: state.op_number,
          sender: state.node_id
        })
        {:noreply, state}
    end
```

Alternative: proactively **truncate** to `op_number - 1` and then accept the leader’s entry (VR allows leader to overwrite uncommitted suffixes). If you have `log_replace` but not a targeted truncate, add a `log_truncate_from(op_number)` callback or re-build from `log_get_from/2`.

## 2) Use a **stable, explicit membership** for leader selection

Avoid sorting PIDs/opaque terms. Store a shared, ordered list of replica IDs (e.g., atoms, integers, UUIDs) agreed by all members, and compute:

```elixir
# At cluster setup
%{state | members: Enum.sort(stable_ids), cluster_size: length(stable_ids)}

defp primary_for_view(view, state) do
  Enum.at(state.members, rem(view, state.cluster_size))
end

defp primary(state), do: primary_for_view(state.view_number, state)
```

If you must keep `replicas` as a `MapSet`, add a distinct `member_ids :: [term]` that all nodes initialize identically and use *only* that for primary calculation.

## 3) Make quorum math consistently use **cluster\_size**

Unify all majority checks on `state.cluster_size`:

* `has_quorum?/1`: keep `connected_count` if you’re actually tracking liveness; otherwise just use `cluster_size` (or remove the gate—right now it’s effectively always true).
* `maybe_commit_operation/2`: compare ACKs against `div(state.cluster_size, 2)`; not `MapSet.size(state.replicas)+1`. That way if someone explicitly sets `cluster_size`, you won’t under-count required ACKs.

## 4) Use the leader’s view when requesting state

In both the “gap” and conflict paths:

```elixir
%GetState{view: prepare.view, ...}
```

…and optionally ignore `NewState` whose `view < state.view_number`.

## 5) Clear per-view counters on **any** view adoption

You already clear `prepare_ok_count` in some places. Do the same when:

* Adopting a higher view via `Prepare`
* Accepting `NewState`
* Processing `StartView`

(You handled two of those; add it to `new_state_impl/2`.)

## 6) Optional but recommended: prefer **truncate-and-catch-up** over `GetState`

VR commonly overwrites uncommitted suffixes. A concise approach:

* On conflict at `i`: truncate log to `i-1`, set `op_number := i-1`, then treat the `Prepare` as `log_length + 1` and append.
* If there’s a **gap** (`i > log_length + 1`), ask for state (`GetState`) or ask for entries from `log_length+1`.

This reduces full-state transfers and lines up with the leader-driven overwrite rule.

## 7) Duplicate request handling (client semantics)

To make retries get the identical reply even while the original is “processing”:

* Keep a per-client **waiter list** (the `from` values) alongside the `{:processing, request_id}` entry, or
* Immediately reply to duplicates with a special token like `{:inflight, request_id}` and let the client poll, or
* Cache `(request_id -> result)` and on commit **broadcast** the result to all recorded `from`s, then collapse to `{:cached, request_id, result}`.

Not a VR safety issue, but it’s the difference between “exactly-once view” that users expect and silent timeouts.

# Smaller notes / tidy-ups

* `StartViewChange`/`Ack` path works because any node that *enters* view-change broadcasts an ack (which you treat as the “I’m in” message). The naming is unconventional; a future reader may assume you count the wrong thing. A comment there would help.

* `NewState`: after acceptance, consider calling `reset_primary_inactivity_timer/1` (you’re a follower) and clearing `view_change_votes`.

* `Prepare` carries `commit_number`; followers can advance commits earlier by applying up to that number (it’s an optimization; safe either way since you also receive `Commit`).

---

## Why these fixes matter (safety lens)

* **Conflict ACK** is the only true red-flag: acknowledging a different value at the same `(view, op)` can let two different leaders in the same/next view “prove” different logs with majorities that don’t intersect on content. That breaks linearizability.

* **Deterministic primary** prevents split-brain after view changes. Even with perfect quorums, if nodes disagree on who primary is for v, you can end up with two leaders issuing `Prepare`s in the same view.

* **Quorum constants** must reflect the configured cluster, not a local count, or you risk committing with < majority in mis-configuration scenarios.

Apply those three and the implementation lines up with the standard VR invariants; the rest are quality and convergence improvements.
