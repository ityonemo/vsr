The provided implementation of Viewstamped Replication (VSR) as a GenServer has several logical issues that deviate from the standard VSR protocol (as described in the "Viewstamped Replication Revisited" paper). These could lead to incorrect behavior, such as duplicated operations, unsafe view changes, inconsistent state after view changes, and failure to commit uncommitted operations correctly. Below, I flag only the logical correctness problems, grouped by protocol phase.
Normal Operation Issues

Lack of client request deduplication and retry handling: The implementation does not include client identifiers or request sequence numbers in operations or the log. In VSR, requests include a client-id and request-number to ensure at-most-once semantics. Without this, client retries (e.g., due to timeouts) will always append new log entries and execute duplicate operations, even if the original was prepared but not committed. Additionally, there is no logic to re-prepare uncommitted operations in a new view when a client retries; instead, retries would incorrectly assign new op_numbers.
Client table is defined but unused: The client_table field in the state is initialized but never read or updated. In VSR, a client table is essential for tracking the last known request per client and storing results for duplicates/replies. This omission exacerbates the deduplication issue.
Sender_id in log entries stores client info incorrectly: The sender_id in LogEntry is set to the client's from (GenServer.from), but without client-id/request-number, it cannot reliably map back to clients for replies or deduplication. Replies are sent only on commit, but retries could lead to multiple entries for the same logical request.

View Change Issues

Incorrect log selection during view change: In do_view_change_impl, the implementation does not collect and compare all received DoViewChange messages properly. It only counts sender IDs and, when the count exceeds the majority, compares only the op_number of the current (tipping) DoViewChange message against the primary's state to select a log. In VSR, the new primary must collect all DoViewChange messages (at least a quorum), then select the log from the message with the highest last_normal_view (v'), breaking ties with the highest op_number. The selected message's log, op_number, and commit_number are adopted wholesale (not maxed or merged incrementally). The current approach could select a stale or incorrect log if the tipping message is not the most up-to-date.
No inclusion of the primary's own state in log selection: The log selection logic treats the primary's current state as a baseline but does not explicitly include it as one of the "messages" in the comparison set. In VSR, the primary's own log, last_normal_view, op_number, and commit_number should be considered alongside the received ones during the iterative selection process.
Missing PrepareOK messages from backups after StartView: In start_view_impl, backups update their log, op_number, and commit_number but do not send PrepareOk messages to the new primary for uncommitted operations (ops > commit_number) in the new log. In VSR, backups must send these to confirm they have the entries, allowing the primary to commit them if needed (e.g., on client retry). Without this, uncommitted operations may never commit in the new view unless clients retry (and even then, duplicates occur due to the earlier issue).
No application of committed operations after StartView: In start_view_impl, after replacing the log and updating commit_number, the implementation does not call apply_committed_operations (or equivalent) to execute any newly committed operations (from old commit_number + 1 to new commit_number). In VSR, replicas must execute all known committed operations immediately after processing StartView to ensure the state machine is up-to-date.

State Transfer Issues

Inconsistent inner state handling during transfer: In new_state_impl, the inner state is set directly via set_inner_state, assuming the received state_machine_state reflects execution up to commit_number. However, if the log includes operations from different views or unapplied commits, and the module does not override set_state to replay or validate, this could lead to inconsistencies between the log and inner state. In VSR, state transfer must ensure the receiver's state machine matches the log up to commit_number, which may require replaying operations if no snapshot is used.

General Issues

Quorum checks assume static connectivity without failure removal: The implementation uses a fixed cluster_size and replicas set, with quorum checks based on this full size. However, if nodes fail or partition (and sends fail), the view change vote counting correctly requires a majority of the full cluster (via ack counts), but normal operations proceed without detecting reduced connectivity (quorum? is always true in a static setup). This is mostly correct for crash failures but could allow operations in a minority if failure detection/removal were added later without adjustments.
View numbers not stamped consistently in messages: While log entries include view, some messages (e.g., Commit, Heartbeat) lack explicit checks for view mismatches beyond basic ignores. In VSR, all protocol messages include the view to prevent processing stale information from old views.

These issues could cause safety violations (e.g., duplicated executions, lost operations) or liveness problems (e.g., stuck uncommitted ops after view changes). The protocol relies on quorums intersecting across views to preserve invariants like operation ordering, but the log selection and deduplication flaws break this.
