# VSR Project - Current State Summary

## 🎯 Overall Status: EXCELLENT
- **All 14 tests passing** ✅
- **Zero compiler warnings** ✅
- **Step 1 of 6 COMPLETE** ✅

## 📋 What We Just Accomplished (Step 1: Quorum Configuration & Monitoring)

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Fixed all registry conflicts** - Unique replica IDs across test suites (101, 201, 302, 401, 501, 601, 701)
2. **Added quorum monitoring** - `total_quorum_number` configuration and connection tracking
3. **Enhanced connection management** - `connect/2` API with `Process.monitor/1`
4. **Improved error handling** - Proper `:DOWN` message handling for replica failures

## 📁 Files Modified (Most Recent First):

### 1. `test/vsr/replica_test.exs` (Last Edited)
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed all registry conflicts using unique replica IDs
- Updated all test setups to use `name: nil` to avoid global registration
- Connected replicas properly in multi-replica test scenarios
- Fixed syntax errors with missing `do`/`end` blocks

### 2. `lib/vsr/replica.ex` (Second Most Recent)
**Major Enhancements:**
- Added `total_quorum_number` configuration parameter
- Implemented `connect/2` GenServer call for dynamic replica connections
- Added `Process.monitor/1` for connected replicas with monitoring references
- Enhanced `handle_info({:DOWN, ...})` for proper replica disconnection handling
- Fixed `start_link/1` to support optional `name` parameter
- Added quorum loss detection and logging

### 3. `SPECIFICATION.md` (Third Most Recent)
**Complete Rewrite:**
- Added detailed internal state changes for each VSR operation
- Documented what happens inside replicas for each message type
- Enhanced with proper message flow descriptions
- Added state machine integration patterns

## 🔧 What's Currently Working:

### ✅ Core VSR Protocol
- **Normal operation**: Primary-backup coordination
- **View changes**: Complete view change protocol with leader election
- **State transfer**: Lagging replicas can sync from others
- **Key-value operations**: PUT/GET/DELETE with proper logging
- **Blocking behavior**: Test-friendly blocking mode

### ✅ Connection Management
- Dynamic replica connections via `connect/2`
- Monitoring with automatic cleanup on failures
- Quorum awareness and loss detection

### ✅ Test Coverage
- 14 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
- Proper isolation with unique replica IDs
- Multi-replica coordination tests
- Error handling and edge cases

## 🚧 What's NOT Broken (All Systems Operational)
- No known bugs or issues
- All tests passing consistently
- Clean compiler output

## 🎯 Next Steps (Remaining Plan):
2. **VSR Message Structs & Clean Handling** - `vsr_send()` and structured messages
3. **Abstract Log Storage** - `Vsr.Log` protocol with `Vsr.EtsLog`
4. **Abstract State Machine** - `Vsr.StateMachine` protocol with `Vsr.KV`
5. **Final Integration & Testing**

## 📈 Project Stats:
- **Lines of Code**: ~650 in replica.ex, ~290 in tests
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% (14/14 passing)
- **Architecture**: Clean GenServer-based with proper OTP supervision
- **Performance**: Sub-second test execution

The VSR implementation is now robust and ready for the next architectural improvements!
