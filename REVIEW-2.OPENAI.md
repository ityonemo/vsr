Happy to zoom in on VSR logic only. Here are the correctness issues I see in the algorithmic behavior (function names point to where the problem shows up):

### Message routing / view tracking

* **Prepare replies can go to the wrong node.** `send_prepare_ok/2` sends to `primary(state)`, which is derived from *local* membership and `state.view_number`. In `prepare_impl/2` you accept a `%Prepare{view: V}` that may be **> `state.view_number`**, but you neither (a) bump `state.view_number` nor (b) reply to the *sender* of the Prepare. Result: `PrepareOk` can be sent to the wrong node/old primary. The `%Prepare{}` struct also carries no primary id, only `from` (client), so the receiver can’t even target the actual leader.

  * **Fix:** Include `leader_id` (or `sender`) in all leader→follower RPCs (`Prepare`, `Commit`, `Heartbeat`, `StartView`), and reply directly to that id. If `prepare.view > state.view_number`, adopt that view (and set `status :normal`) before responding.

* **Heartbeats are view-less.** `%Heartbeat{}` has no `view`; `heartbeat_impl/2` resets the timer unconditionally. A stale/partitioned old leader can indefinitely suppress view-change in a newer view.

  * **Fix:** Carry `view` and `leader_id` in heartbeat; only reset timers if `view == state.view_number` and `leader_id == primary(state)`.

### Commit application & state transfer

* **Committed ops aren’t applied on view change.** In the new primary (`do_view_change_impl/2`) you broadcast `%StartView{commit_number: K}`, and in replicas (`start_view_impl/2`) you set `commit_number: K` and replace the log, but **neither side calls `apply_committed_operations/2`**. The inner state can diverge from `commit_number`.

  * **Fix:** After installing a new view (both at the new primary and at replicas), immediately run `apply_committed_operations(state, start_view.commit_number)`.

* **`NewState` handling blindly trusts any sender.** `new_state_impl/2` overwrites log, view, commit number, and inner state if `new_state.view >= state.view_number`, regardless of who sent it.

  * **Fix:** Process `NewState` only if it’s from the current `primary_for_view(new_state.view, state)` (or include/verify `leader_id`). Otherwise ignore.

### View-change protocol (safety & liveness)

* **Wrong quorum threshold for `DO-VIEW-CHANGE`.** In `do_view_change_impl/2` you require `length(updated_messages) > div(N, 2)` where `updated_messages` counts *backups only*. That forces a majority of **others**, not a majority **including self**. For N=5 you require 3 backups (too strict); for N=3 you require both backups (too strict) → hurts liveness.

  * **Fix:** Require `1 + length(updated_messages) > div(N, 2)` (count self implicitly).

* **Log selection uses only the last message.** When quorum is reached, you choose `merged_log` by comparing just the **single** `do_view_change` that tipped you over against your local state:

  ```elixir
  if do_view_change.op_number > state.op_number do
    received_log else current_log
  end
  ```

  That ignores all previously collected `DoViewChange`s (and `last_normal_view`). This can select a log that **loses** operations that were prepared/committed on a different replica and still in the majority set.

  * **Fix:** Among the collected `DoViewChange`s that form the quorum, pick the log with the **highest (last\_normal\_view, op\_number)** (per VSR), and set `commit_number` to the **max** of their `commit_number`s. Then install that log.

* **Timers aren’t reset on role change.** After becoming primary in `do_view_change_impl/2` you don’t start the heartbeat timer; after installing a new view in `start_view_impl/2` you don’t reset the follower’s primary inactivity timer.

  * **Fix:** On entering/leaving primary role, call `start_heartbeat_timer/1` (primary) or `reset_primary_inactivity_timer/1` (followers).

* **`ViewChangeOk` is unused.** You send `%ViewChangeOk{}` in `start_view_impl/2`, but the primary ignores it; if you intend to wait for acks before normal operation, that logic is missing. (Not strictly required by all variants, but as written the message is vestigial.)

### Prepare/ack accounting across views

* **ACK counts aren’t keyed by view.** `prepare_ok_count` is keyed only by `op_number`. After a view change, old counts can be reused for the same `op_number` in a new view, producing spurious commits. You also never clear counts on view change.

  * **Fix:** Key by `{view, op_number}` and clear all counts on view change (or at least all for `view < state.view_number`).

* **Accepting higher-view `Prepare` without view update breaks commit.** `commit_impl/2` applies only if `commit.view == state.view_number`. If a follower accepts `Prepare` with `prepare.view > state.view_number` but keeps its old `state.view_number`, it will ignore subsequent `Commit` for that higher view.

  * **Fix:** See the first item: advance to `prepare.view` when accepting a higher-view message.

### Client semantics (linearizability / at-most-once)

* **No deduplication, no stable client ids.** VSR relies on `(client_id, request_num)` and a client table to ensure at-most-once semantics and to return cached replies after leader failover. Your `client_table` exists but is never used; you store `sender_id` (a transient `GenServer.from()`) in log entries and only the **primary** replies in `apply_committed_operations/2`. If the primary crashes after committing but before replying, the new primary won’t reply, and a client retry can re-execute the operation.

  * **Fix:** Include `client_id` and `request_id` in requests and log entries; maintain a client table (latest `request_id` → result). On commit, **any** replica (or at least the new primary) should be able to serve a duplicate by returning the cached result without re-executing.

### Quorum gating / membership

* **`quorum?/1` is effectively a no-op.** It computes

  ```elixir
  replica_count = MapSet.size(state.replicas) + 1
  replica_count > div(state.cluster_size, 2)
  ```

  but `cluster_size` is set to `replica_count` in `set_cluster_impl/3`, so this is always true. The “no quorum” path in `client_request_impl/2` will never trigger after configuration.

  * **Fix:** Either remove this gate or make it meaningful (e.g., track *live* peers via monitors/heartbeats and compare live count to `cluster_size`).

### Misc protocol mismatches

* **`StartView`/`Prepare` don’t carry enough identity.** Multiple spots assume you can recompute the primary deterministically (`primary(state)`), but during view races or membership disagreement that’s fragile. Carry `leader_id` on every leader→follower RPC and verify it.
* **`GetState`/`NewState` flow can regress state.** You request state on a gap (`GetState` to `primary(state)`), but then accept any `NewState` with a higher/equal view. A non-leader or a node in a different view can push a conflicting state.

  * **Fix:** Only answer `GetState` at leader; only accept `NewState` from the leader for that view; include and check `leader_id`.

## Concrete fixes summary

1. Add `leader_id` and `view` to `Prepare/Commit/Heartbeat/StartView/NewState`; always verify `view` and `leader_id` on receipt; reply to `leader_id`, not `primary(state)`.
2. When receiving a higher-view RPC, advance `state.view_number` (and `status :normal`) before acting.
3. Key `prepare_ok_count` by `{view, op_number}` and clear on view change.
4. In new-primary path: wait for a quorum **including self**; select log by **max (last\_normal\_view, op\_number)** across the quorum; set `commit_number := max(commit_number_i)`; start heartbeats.
5. After `StartView` (both sides), immediately call `apply_committed_operations(state, commit_number)` and reset appropriate timers.
6. Implement client deduplication using `(client_id, request_id)` in the log and a `client_table`; allow the new primary to return cached replies.
7. Restrict `NewState` to the leader only; validate sender.
8. Make `quorum?/1` reflect actual live quorum or remove it.

Fixing the above will align the implementation with VSR’s safety (no lost committed operations, correct leader-only behavior) and liveness (progress with only a majority alive).
