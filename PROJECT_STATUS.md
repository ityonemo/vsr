# VSR Project Status Summary

## Current State Overview

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Core VSR Implementation**: Basic Viewstamped Replication algorithm is implemented
- **Replica Initialization**: GenServers start correctly with proper state
- **Key-Value Operations**: Basic PUT/GET/DELETE operations work for single replicas
- **Normal Operation**: Primary-backup coordination works for multi-replica setups
- **View Changes**: Basic view change protocol is implemented
- **Blocking Behavior**: Replicas can be configured to block operations until unblocked
- **Registry System**: Replicas can find each other via Registry for message passing
- **Application Supervision**: Proper OTP application structure with supervision tree

### ‚úÖ Tests Passing (13/14)
- Replica initialization and state management
- Normal operation with primary-backup coordination  
- Key-value store operations (put/get/delete)
- View change protocol
- Blocking behavior
- Most distributed consensus scenarios

### ‚ùå What's Broken (1 failing test)
- **State Transfer**: The "lagging replica requests and receives state" test fails
  - Replica2 op_number remains 0 instead of catching up to 2
  - State synchronization between replicas isn't working properly
  - The `get_state/2` API call and corresponding message handling needs fixes

## Key Implementation Details

### lib/vsr/replica.ex (650 lines)
- **GenServer-based replicas** with full VSR state machine
- **4-element log entries**: `{view, op_number, operation, sender_id}`
- **ETS-backed storage** for key-value operations
- **Message-passing coordination** between replicas via Registry
- **Complete VSR protocol**: prepare, prepare-ok, commit phases
- **View change support** with majority voting
- **Blocking mode** for testing scenarios

### State Transfer Issue
The remaining failure is in state synchronization:
- `Replica.get_state(replica2, replica1)` should sync replica2's state
- Current implementation sends messages but doesn't properly update lagging replica
- Need to fix the `handle_info({:new_state, ...})` logic

### Technical Debt
- **Duplicate handle_cast clause** causing compiler warning
- **State transfer logic** needs refinement for proper synchronization
- **Error handling** could be more robust for network partitions

## Next Steps
1. Fix duplicate `handle_cast` clause in replica.ex
2. Debug and fix state transfer synchronization
3. Ensure all 14 tests pass consistently
4. Add more comprehensive error handling
5. Consider adding performance optimizations

The VSR implementation is 95% complete with a solid foundation for distributed consensus in Elixir.
