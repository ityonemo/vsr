# VSR Project Analysis

## What we found:
- **Viewstamped Replication for Elixir** - A distributed consensus algorithm library
- Currently just a skeleton project with:
  - Empty `Vsr` module in `lib/vsr.ex`
  - Basic mix.exs setup
  - Empty test structure
  - Standard Elixir library structure

## Viewstamped Replication Background:
- Distributed consensus algorithm (like Raft or PBFT)
- Handles Byzantine fault tolerance
- Used for building distributed systems that need to agree on state
- Original paper by Barbara Liskov and James Cowling

## Current State:
- No implementation - just scaffolding
- Ready for us to build the VSR algorithm from scratch
- Could be a powerful distributed systems library for Elixir

## Next Steps Options:
1. Implement the core VSR algorithm
2. Build a demo application showing VSR in action
3. Create comprehensive tests first (TDD approach)
4. Research and plan the full VSR specification
